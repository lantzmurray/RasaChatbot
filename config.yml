pipeline:
  # Split user input into words (basic tokenization based on spaces)
  - name: WhitespaceTokenizer

  # Detect patterns like emails, numbers, account IDs using regular expressions
  - name: RegexFeaturizer

  # Extract simple features about words (like casing, position, punctuation)
  - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer

  # Convert words into numerical counts (bag-of-words model)
  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer

  # (Optional) Create character-level features (good for misspellings)

  # Main model: Jointly predict intent and extract entities
  - name: DIETClassifier
    epochs: 100

  # Map extracted entity synonyms to canonical forms (e.g., "cell phone" â†’ "mobile")
  - name: EntitySynonymMapper

  # Select the best matching response if using retrieval-based intents (good for FAQs)
  - name: ResponseSelector
    epochs: 100

  # Handle low confidence or ambiguous predictions (fallback to default action)
  - name: FallbackClassifier
    threshold: 0.3               # If confidence of top intent is below 0.3, trigger fallback
    ambiguity_threshold: 0.1     # If top two intents are very close, trigger fallback
